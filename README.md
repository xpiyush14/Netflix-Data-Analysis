# Netflix-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a Netflix movie dataset to uncover meaningful insights through data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization. The main goal was to understand content trends, genre popularity, and audience preferences on the platform.

# Objectives
Clean and preprocess raw Netflix dataset for accurate analysis.
Identify patterns in genres, release years, and ratings.
Categorize movies based on popularity (vote averages).
Use data visualization to present insights effectively.

# Problems Addressed
Q1)Which genre is most frequent on Netflix?
Q2)How has the trend of movie releases evolved over the years?
Q3)What does the distribution of ratings (vote averages) reveal about audience preferences?
Q4)Which genres are more popular based on ratings?

# Steps Taken

1.) Data Preprocessing
Imported dataset, checked shape, size, datatypes.
Removed duplicates & unnecessary columns.
Converted release dates into years.
Transformed the genre column (split multiple genres, exploded rows, set as categorical).

2.) Feature Engineering
Categorized movies based on vote averages (Not Popular, Below Average, Average, Popular).

3.) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized genre frequency to identify top categories.
Analyzed yearly trends in Netflix movie releases.
Plotted rating distributions to observe audience ratings.
Explored genre-wise popularity.

# Key Skills Applied
Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling dates, duplicates, unnecessary columns).
Data Wrangling (splitting and restructuring genres).
Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization.
Categorical Data Handling & Feature Engineering.

# Outcome
The analysis provided a clear understanding of Netflixâ€™s content trends, showing which genres dominate, how content has evolved over years, and how audiences rate different movies.
